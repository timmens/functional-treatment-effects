This article examines the inference for functional treatment effects in linear
function-on-scalar regression models. Inference is accomplished using simultaneous
confidence bands based on adaptive critical value functions that allow inference under
fairness constraints, making the results interpretable both locally and globally. To
leverage existing methods in causal inference, we extend the potential outcome
framework, directed acyclic graphs, and robust variance estimation to the case of
functional data. Our developments are motivated by a case study in sports biomechanics,
where we seek to estimate the effects of forefoot running on ankle strength from
observational data.
